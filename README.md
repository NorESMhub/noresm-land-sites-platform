# Platform for NorESM site-level simulation over land

###### doi:

## Overview and documentation
The platform aims to facilitate the site-level simulations over land using [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) and its land component [CTSM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/CTSM) with the developing vegetation demographic module [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). It privdes **optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites** with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations accross Nordic regions without techincal obstacles.

The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observation and model, and **promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve the NorESM** and its land component on the one hand, and **promote the usage of the NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers** on the other hand.

For more information on the platform, please see our [wiki]() and [technical documentation]().


## Quick guides for using the platform

* ### Developer: *Workflows for developing and using the platform*
  - See [documentation]()

* ### User: *GALAXY tools, workflows and tutorials*
  - A graphic user interface for running site-level simulation is available on the cloud computing platform [GALAXY](https://galaxyproject.org/) as a tool (CTSM/FATES-EMERALD), with a dedicated [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/fates/tutorial.html) and [workflows]() for its usage.
  - Please contact [Anne Fouilloux](https://github.com/annefou) for the development of GALAXY tools related to the platform.
