<h1>Build and run cases from existing settings files</h1>
<div>
The NorESM landsites platform uses settings files to build and run customized
single-point NorESM model experiments for selected locations. In this section,
you can specify a previously created settings file to
<a href="https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/" target="_blank">
make cases</a>, i.e., automatically download the input data and create and
adapt directories that contain the files required by the underlying model. In
addition, you can subsequently
<a href="https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/" target="_blank">
run cases</a>, i.e., start the actual model simulation.<br><br>

<span style="color:red;">Attention!</span> There are two important constraints
you need to be aware of:
<ul>
  <li>You can only run cases that have previously been built. If you try to
    run an experiment from a settings file that has not been used as input
    for the 'build' step before, an error will occur.</li>
  <li>If you make any changes to a previously built case (e.g., change
    parameter values in a settings file <b>after</b> creating the case
    directory), you need to rebuild the case, i.e., reexecute the 'build' step
    to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
