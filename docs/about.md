# Platform for NorESM site-level simulation over land

doi: ***under construction***

The NorESM-LSP (LSP for short) aims to facilitate site-level simulations over land using [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) and its land component [CTSM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/CTSM) with the developing vegetation demographic module [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). 

The platform aims to lower the technical barriers to vegetation demographic modelling with NorESM-CLM-FATES. In doing so, we aim to help bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve the models and its land component, and to promote the usage of NorESM-CLM-FATES to new audiences and research settings.

The observation sites currently included in the platform are described in the [Sites](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/land-sites/) page.

## Acknowledgements
The NorESM-LSP has evolved over several years from the needs and visions of a large group of researchers and students connected through the EMERALD and LATICE projects. Funding has come from the projects listed above. Thanks are due to everyone who participated along the way in discussions, feedback, and testing of early versions.
The NorESM-LSP software wraps around the NorESM-CLM-FATES model framework. The Norwegian Earth System Model is developed by a [consortium](https://www.noresm.org/consortium/), and is closely related to the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The CESM and Community Land Model are supported primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The FATES model is supported primarily by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment - Tropics (NGEE-T) project.

## How to cite
If you publish something based on simulations through the LSP, please cite the software in your publication. For now, cite the NorESM Land Sites Platform as: **NorESM-LSP development team. 2022. The NorESM Land Sites Platform (Version v1) [Computer software]**. Look for our upcoming technical description paper and DOIs for the repositories, which will provide better citation options. Remember to cite the models (NorESM, CLM and FATES) appropriately as well if you publish model experiments.

If you requested new sites and an LSP developer helped you, please consider adding that person to the Acknowledgements section of your publication or invite them to co-author you publication if the contribution is substantial. See for instance the [ICMJE authorship guidelines (Vancouver convention)](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) to help you decide which kind of acknowledgement is appropriate.

## Contact

For questions about the platform, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm-land-sites-platform/issues/) on GitHub or get in touch with one of the code developers directly.
