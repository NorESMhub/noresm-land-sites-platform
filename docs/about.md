# Platform for NorESM site-level simulation over land

doi: ***under construction***

## Overview and documentation
The platform aims to facilitate site-level simulations over land using [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) and its land component [CTSM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/CTSM) with the developing vegetation demographic module [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). It provides **optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites** with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations with minimal techincal obstacles.

The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, and **promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve NorESM** and its land component on the one hand, and **promote the usage of NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers** on the other hand.

The observation sites currently included in the platform are described in the [Land sites](https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/land-sites/) section.
