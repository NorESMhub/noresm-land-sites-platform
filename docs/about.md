# Platform for NorESM site-level simulation over land

doi: ***under construction***

## Overview and documentation
The platform aims to facilitate site-level simulations over land using [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) and its land component [CTSM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/CTSM) with the developing vegetation demographic module [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). It provides **optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites** with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations with minimal techincal obstacles.

The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, and **promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve NorESM** and its land component on the one hand, and **promote the usage of NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers** on the other hand.

The observation sites currently included in the platform are described in the [Land sites](https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/land-sites/) section. 

## Quick guides for using the platform

* ### Quick installation for developers
Instructions for installation are found in the [repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform). Note that we are using NREC for development and testing for the time being. In the future, we want a more flexible solution using Docker. To use NREC, you need a user account and to apply for resources, so get in touch if you need this!

* ### User: *GALAXY tools, workflows and tutorials*
  - A graphic user interface for running site-level simulation is available on the cloud computing platform [GALAXY](https://galaxyproject.org/) as a tool (CTSM/FATES-EMERALD), with a dedicated [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/fates/tutorial.html) and [workflows]() for its usage.
  - Please contact [Anne Fouilloux](https://github.com/annefou) for the development of GALAXY tools related to the platform.
