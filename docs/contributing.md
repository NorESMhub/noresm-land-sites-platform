# How to contribute to the NorESM land sites platform

The NorESM land sites platform is developed by a group of students, postdocs, and software engineers when we have the time or need certain functionalities. We welcome anyone to join us in developing new functionalities, using the platform, add to the documentation, and contribute to making this platform a dynamic and useful research and teaching tool. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for improvements, please open an [issue](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/issues) in the repository. Any contributions and involvement in our community must be in line with our [Code of conduct](https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/code_of_conduct).

## How to contribute to the code

We use our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform) for developing code. If you are new to working with Git and GitHub, you might like [this](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/ "a minimalist intro") or [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world "GitHub's own tutorial") tutorial. 

The current version of the platform is kept in the `main` branch of the repository, and further development happens on the `platform_dev` branch. If you are developing code, please fork the repository and make your changes there before creating a pull request to the `platform_dev` branch when changes are complete. Testing can be done on different machines, such as an image on NREC, or using Saga, Fram, or even a local computer. 

## How to contribute to the documentation

This documentation page is built using GitHub pages and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). 

To edit this documentation page, go to the main branch of the [github repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform), and navigate to the `docs/` folder. To edit the main documentation page, open the index.md file and make your changes, using Markdown syntax. Then commit (save changes) and start a pull request (to enter your changes into the repository -- must be approved by an admin). The same procedure can be used for this Contributing section from the contributing.md file, and so on.
