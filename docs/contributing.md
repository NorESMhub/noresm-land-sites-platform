## How to contribute to the documentation

This documentation page is built using GitHub pages and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). 

To edit this documentation page, go to the main branch of the [github repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform), and navigate to the docs/ folder. To edit the main documentation page, open the index.md file and make your changes, using Markdown syntax. Then commit (save changes) and start a pull request (to enter your changes into the repository -- must be approved by an admin). The same procedure can be used for this Contributing section from the contributing.md file. 

NB! The [About](https://noresmhub.github.io/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/about/) section is mirrored from the main repository README.md file, and should *not* be touched from the docs/ folder. To make changes, edit the README file in the repository!
