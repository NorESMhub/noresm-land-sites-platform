The NorESM-LSP simplifies the modelling process and model setup with [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM)-[CLM](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM)-[FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). The software might be used ...

1. In education, such as interdisciplinary workshops or data labs in Ecological Climatology-related university courses, where model experiments will typically be simple and designed to increase understanding of the model framework and Earth System Science.
2. By beginner modelers, e.g. post-graduate students or scientists who are new to CLM-FATES modelling, to set up scientific model experiments under the supervision of or in collaboration with more experienced modelers. 
3. By experienced modelers without access to HPC clusters with the models installed, who benefit from the containerisation of the model.

We have an open, monthly, online meeting series. To get an invite, send a membership request from your google account to [this google group](https://groups.google.com/g/landsitesplatform) to join the email list.
