# NorESM land sites

This page will contain descriptions, meta data, and relevant reference hyperlinks
for the included land sites.

## Overview

We currently support 18 sites: 12 [Vestland climate grid](https://betweenthefjords.w.uib.no/vestland-climate-grid/) sites and 6 climate station sites of interest to the [LATICE](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/latice/) group. These are locations where there are climate stations and ecological field experiments that make these sites of particular interest.

The Vestland climate grid, often called the SeedClim grid after the first major project that set it up, is a set of calcareous grassland sites across gradients of precipitation and temperature. The sites have been, and still are, host to many ecological reseach projects that study vegetation dynamics, plant interactions, functional traits and climate responses. Each site also has loggers for temperature and other climatic variables: ...

*Illustration from the SeedClim project: In the first project, turf squares (top soil, roots and whole plants) were cut out and physically transplanted to other sites, as indicated by the arrows in the top left corner. The vegetation in these turfs was carefully monitored over several years in their new locations, to see how and how quickly the plants adapted to a new environment.*
