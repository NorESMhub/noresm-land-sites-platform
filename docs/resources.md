# External tutorials and resources

Do you need more information? Here are some useful links.

While the NorESM-LSP provides an easy interface to run model experiments with the NorESM-CLM-FATES model, interpreting the results and setting up high-quality simulations can be time-consuming and requires specialist knowledge about the models and theoretical knowledge of Earth System science. Here we collect some useful links to tutorials and other resources where you can learn more. If you are new to modelling but want to publish something, it might be a good idea to reach out to someone who is more familiar with the models to find collaborators on your project. The model framework consists of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), the Community Land Model (CLM), and the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES). Each model has its own documentation and tutorials.

This page collects some training resources we have found and think are relevant, but is by no means an exhaustive list.

## Tutorials, courses, papers, and books

### Courses for students and researchers

- CLM/CTSM course at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado (USA). See [this overview of tutorials](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials/). NCAR is the main development hub for the FATES and CLM models, and the Earth System Model CESM (which is similar to NorESM). 
- 10 ETCS course in [Ecological Climatology](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/geofag/GEO5915/) at the University of Oslo, Norway. MSC and PhD level interdisciplinary course for geoscience and biology. Some of the course teachers are involved in developing the NorESM-LSP, and from 2022 the course includes a 1-day data lab with the NorESM-LSP.

### Tutorials you can do from home

- [FATES documentation and user guide](https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). See especially the [FAQ](https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html) and this [slide deck from a 2019 tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kztSENcOOw54XpjDCebcOLWciC8kqJegkMJGnuQKisI/edit).
- [The NCAR-NEON collaboration](https://ncar.github.io/NEON-visualization/) model-data integration project aimed at beginners and researchers in other fields. Their tutorials are very good for learning about CLM (but does not include FATES yet), and they include example code for visualization of output with Jupyter notebooks.
- The university of Bergen has a beginner-friendly intro to earth system science at [Explore the Earth System](https://expearth.uib.no/#post-8) (click on land, ocean, etc. for more info!)
