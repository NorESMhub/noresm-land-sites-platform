This spinup simulation was conducted using \"accelerated decomposition\", or \"AD\" mode. This accelerates the turnover time of \"slow\" ecosystem C and N pools (soil, wood, and coarse woody debris) so they come into equilibrium more quickly. On the left, the model ran in AD mode for 100 years cycling through atmospheric forcing for 1981 to 2000. AD mode was invoked with the commands: <code>./xmlchange CLM_FORCE_COLDSTART=on</code> and <code>./xmlchange CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP=on</code>. On the right, the model was run again in a \"post-AD\" simulation (using the end of our \"AD\" simulation as the starting point) for another 100 years with <code>./xmlchange CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP=off</code>. In returning the turnover times of slow C and N pools to their intended rates, the pool sizes must be adjusted from their \"AD\" steady-state. For example if the turnover of \"passive\" soil C was 10x faster in AD mode, the passive soil C pool needs to be 10x larger starting the post-AD simulation (the model automatically handles this conversion for you). Running the simulation for 100 years in post-AD mode allows the state variables to equilibrate with non-accelerated decomposition. In post-AD mode the history files are monthly, whereas AD output is set to annual averages by default. This difference in history file output frequency is reflected in the variability in the post-AD output.\n",
