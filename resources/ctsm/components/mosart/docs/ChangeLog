One-line Summary: Change compset in test

In an upcoming CTSM tag, the compset I2000Clm50BgcCropGs will be renamed
to I2000Clm50BgcCrop (while keeping the same meaning as before). This
tag changes a test to use the new alias, to keep MOSART compatible with
this upcoming CTSM tag.

Note that this change will require the upcoming CTSM tag (probably
ctsm5.1.dev011) in order to run this test from the mosart test list.

One-line Summary: Bring updates needed for NUOPC

Some more changes from @mvertens with updates for the NUOPC cap. 
There's a new nuopc_cap_share directory added. SetVM is made public
in rof_comp_nuopc.F90 and some of the logging is slightly changed. 
RtmIO is now using ROFID rather than instance name.

Also convert the nldas2 file into NetCDF5 format from Jim Edwards.

One-line Summary: Updates to NUOPC cap

Main purpose is updates to NUOPC cap. Also a fix for PIO2.

Most changes are from Mariana Vertenstein, brought to master by Bill
Sacks.

These changes are documented in https://github.com/ESCOMP/MOSART/pull/30

Testing: mosart test suite (cheyenne & izumi), in the context of a CTSM
checkout (https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/939). Baseline comparisons
done against ctsm1.0.dev085.

One-line Summary: Add nuopc cap for NUOPC coupler option

Add another driver cap for NUOPC in addition to the MCT cap.
As part of this rof_cpl_indices.F90 which was shared under
"src/cpl" was moved inside of the "src/cpl/mct" with "rof"
renamed to "mosart" since this isn't shared in between the
driver caps. The NUOPC cap doesn't use the coupler integer
indexes, only the character names.

A helper module for NUOPC ESMF functionality was added called
rof_comp_nuopc.

This also meant that nt_rtm and rtm_tracers was moved from
the rof_cpl_indices file to RtmVar.F90 so it could be shared
between the two caps.

Also to match the nuopc cap the import_export part of the
MCT cap was pulled out in it's own file.

Testing: Run mosart test suite (with ctsm tag ctsm1.0.dev049 and
         branch_tags/cime5.8.3_chint17-03

One-line Summary:  Move release-cesm2.0.03 to mosart master

Don't allow the namelist option rtmhist_ndens to be set to 2, because this
option doesn't currently function. The simple fix we put into place for it
is not robust.

Fix for python3, using the floor operator for integer division.

Add in 8th degree routine file. Run pylint and check for py3 compatability.
There's explict setting of fill type. And also explicit use of shr_kind_r4 for 
kind rather than real(4), which is a better mechanism. Also ncd_getiodesc 
will read in PIO_DOUBLE for input xtype= PIO_DOUBLE or PIO_REAL. Most of this
is direct from jedwards4b (other than r8th addition).

Issues Fixed: #18 #10
  #18 -- rtmhist_ndens=2 does NOT work (so don't allow it as an option)
  #10 -- With python3, coupling_period is real rather than int

Science  changes since: mosart1_0_31
   Added in 8th degree routing file (r8th)

One-line Summary:  Explicitly truncate the river length to a mininum value, rather than
                   just change the calculation of tlen for rlen_min.

Testing: Sean and Keith both ran long simulations with this change (in a branch off of 1_0_26)

Previous simulations showed that short rivers would accumulate water in them slowly over 
time. This doesn't happen in longer rivers. But it affects the total water balance of the
system. Simulations by Sean Swenson and Keith Oleson show that this no longer happens
with this change.

Changes from Sean Swenson to add minimum value to rlen (length of main channel); rlen values 
can be too small, leading to tlen values that are too large

M    src/riverroute/RtmIO.F90 - Explicitly set rlen to rlen_min early and remove code that was
        calculating tlen based on rlen_min when rlen<rlen_min. Since rlen is changed this affects code
        that is based on rlen, and can change the if statements that are triggered.

One-line Summary: Treat irrigation specially, fix volr

(1) Together with corresponding cime and clm changes, treats irrigation as a
    separate flux. The point of this is to map irrigation withdrawals normalized
    by volr, to help prevent river channels from going to negative volumes.

(2) Fixes the volr field sent to the coupler

Requires the cime changes from https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/681

In order for the new irrigation changes to have an effect, also requires the CLM
changes from the branch
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branches/limitirrig - although this
code will work correctly without the CLM changes (in this case, irrigation will
simply be 0, and the irrigation flux will be folded in to a different runoff
flux).

Changes are from Sean Swenson; reviewed, tested and brought to the trunk by Bill
Sacks.

Testing: mosart test suite (on yellowstone), from
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branch_tags/limitirrig_tags/limitirrig_n10_clm4_5_12_r196

All tests passed, but with answer changes in r2x_Flrr_volr and x2l_Flrr_volr, as
expected.

Also ran aux_clm45 test suite; most tests passed; I'm looking into remaining
failures and will update mosart if it turns out it was the source of any
problems.
