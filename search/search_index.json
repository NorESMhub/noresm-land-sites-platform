Please let us know if you have suggestions for something to add or explain better in the issues \ud83d\udea7 Platform content You can use the platform to run single-cell model simulations . We provide sites with high quality input data (atmospheric forcing, land surface data, 'spin-up'), and narrow down the long list of possible output variables into something manageable. add an illustration here Input data Running the model requires specifying compsets, atmospheric forcing, land surface parameters, and spin-up to get realistic simulations. The input data are here , with a readme file with further detail. The .tar files are compressed, and can be opened as a folder with e.g. 7-zip by right-clicking and choosing 'open archive', and used after extracting (unzipping). The data files are stored in .nc (NetCDF) format, which can be viewed using Panoply, or packages in Python or R . The output data from simulations are stored in the same format. The input data .tar file contains three folders: (1) 'shared' domain files with gridcell longitude, latitude, and area; (2) land (=lnd) surface data, and (3) atmosphere (=atm) data. The input data are site -specific. Compsets Short for component sets, compsets specify which component models are used as well as specific settings for forcing scenarios and physics options. Compsets have a short name and a longer name with abbreviations denoting the components included. See more in the CLM user guide . Currently, we only support the following compset, with long name: 2000_DATM%1PTGSWP3_CLM50%FATES_SICE_SOCN_MOSART_SGLC_SWAV The notation for the compset longname is: TIME_ATM[%phys]\\_LND[%phys]\\_ICE[%phys]\\_OCN[%phys]\\_ROF[%phys]\\_GLC[%phys]\\_WAV[%phys] The compset longname has a specified order: atm, lnd, ice, ocn, river, glc, and wave. Each component model version may be \"active,\" \"data,\" \"dead,\" or \"stub\". Stub components are used instead of active to save computation time and input requirements when that component is not needed for the model configuration. For instance, the active land component forced with atmospheric data, does not need ice, ocn, or glc components to be active and can replace them with stubs.

Atmospheric forcing Atmospheric forcing data drives the modelled climate using a time series of climatic variables. Downloadable data products exist, but is often on too coarse scales for realistic single-point simulations. Here is a list of atmospheric forcing variables used in CLM: Incident solar radiation (FSDS), W/m2 Temperature at the lowest atmospheric level (TBOT), degrees K (or can be C) Precipitation (PRECTmms), mm/s Wind speed at the lowest atmospheric level (WIND), m/s Forcing data for our sites are stored with the rest of the input data .

The climatic variables in the above list are stored in these files. NASA_LIS: lightning frequency topo_forcing: topography height If you have your own data, you can replace the default input files with your own. under construction: Instruction for how to do this . Make sure the format and units are the exact same, otherwise the model will not be able to use them. For more information on using custom input to CLM, see the CLM documentation Surface data Surface data contains information the model needs about the land surface, such as land use trajectories, soil properties, vegetation parameters, and albedo . Here are some exaples of what the input data .tar contains: 'firedata' population density 'paramdata' CLM5 parameters: many parameters, covering e.g. Plant Functional Types (PFTs), allocation of carbon, photosynthetic pathway FATES parameters: many parameters, covering e.g. Plant Functional Types (PFTs), allometry, carbon pools, nitrogen uptake, mortality, recruitment, fuel load for fire module 'snicardata' snow \"growth\" parameters snow \"optics\" 'surfdata_map' surface data: soil depth & other properties, albedo & thermal conductance of different surface types, and fraction of gridcell covered by vegetation, land, & other land cover types 'urbandata' urban classes, building interior temperature Note that when CLM is running without FATES, a simpler 'big-leaf'-version of vegetation is used instead. The CLM5 and FATES parameters thus overlap to some degree, with FATES replacing some and adding other parameters when activated. For the Vestland climate grid sites , surface data has been created from raw data sets, using this script . There are publicly available data products that could be downloaded and extracted for the nearest model gridcell, given points coordinates, that contain all the necessary surface data. We have not used this; our surface data is interpolated from raw data sets of better resolution. This data should be more accurate than the alternative data products. If you have your own data, you can replace the default input files with your own. under construction: Instruction for how to do this . Make sure the format and units are the same, otherwise the model will not be able to use them. For more information on using custom input to CLM, see the CLM documentation Spin-up To get realistic simulations, the model needs to run for a while to reach a state of equilibrium under the applied forcing. Starting the model from \"bare ground\", the climate is not in equilibrium, there is no or only unrealistic soil, and the model needs time to grow and kill vegetation to get appropriate soil properties and a stable climate. We provide \"restart\" files for our sites with the following spin-up phase settings: under construction Running simulations To run a simulation, you need to set up a case which tells the model how to run. A case can be run several times, or stopped and started again. The NorESM platform provides a settings file that will set some basic information, and scripts to simplify running the case(s). Under NorESM_LandSites_Platform/landsites_tools/simulation/ there are python scripts make_cases.py and run_cases.py . These scripts set up a simulation case directory and creates, builds and downloads input data for the model. For more detailed information on what goes on in CLM and its coupler (which connects CLM to other model components), see this CIME user guide , but note that the NorESM modelling platform uses these commands and scripts more indirectly. The settings file and python scripts combine several of these options and commands to simplify the process of running simulations. Settings file All required information to prepare and run CLM-FATES cases for the available Norwegian land sites is provided via a settings.txt file. A template, which also serves as the default settings if no changes are made, is stored under ~/NorESM_LandSites_Platform/landsites_tools/ . The settings file has the following contents: setting description dir_cases cases root folder, absolute or relative to project dir dir_clm_input clm input root folder, absolute or relative to project dir dir_output output root folder, absolute or relative to project dir start_time at what time should simulation start?

If you are changing the settings file manually, be careful wirh formatting! Upper/lowercase, spaces and symbols need to be correct for it to work. model run types model run type description startup a 'cold' start from bare ground. The vegetation and climate is not in equilibrium and the model will not produce realistic output. No spin-up is included. Use this mode for quick testing, or for making your own spin-up. hybrid the model is initialized similar to a startup run, but uses initialization datasets from a previous case. Suitable when you already have good spin-up files and want a more realistic simulation. branch the model is initialized using a consistent set of restart files from a previous run. The case name is generally changed for a branch run, although it does not have to be. Branch runs are suitable for sensitivity or parameter studies, or when settings for history file output streams need to be modified while still maintaining bit-for-bit reproducibility. restart continues running an existing case after it has been stopped. model types model run type description under construction CLM-SP satellite phenology. CLM-BCG biogeochemistry CLM-FATES FATES vegetation FATES-SP FATES but with satellite phenology FATES-nocomp FATES without competition FATES-hydro FATES with different hydrology make_cases.py This python script creates, builds, and sets up CTSM cases for predefined or custom site locations . It is either using the simulation options specified in a 'settings.txt' file or asks for interactive command line input to create one. Input data is automatically downloaded unless custom input data has been added. When making a new case, it first creates a case directory containing the scripts and XML files to configure a case. Then, it creates scripts needed to run the model along with namelist files . Finally, it compiles the model and builds the executable file from which the case is run. The make_cases.py script uses helper scripts stored in the utils/ folder and commands experienced CLM users will be familiar with, namely create_newcase , case.setup and case.build . run_cases.py This python script runs previously built cases made with make_cases.py . The respective paths need to be defined in a 'settings.txt' file. The model output files will be created in the data/output/CASE_NAME directory by default, but a different path can be specified. Depending on the length of simulation, and computational resources available, this can take some time. The script calls on the case.submit command that experienced CLM users will be familiar with. Postprocess output files Output is stored in .nc (NetCDF) format, which can be viewed using Panoply, or packages in Python or R history variables Each output .nc file contains information for several history variables, such as ... under construction plotting Suggestions for plotting output are given in a Jupyter notebook in the repository under the /notebooks directory.

Prerequisites (first time setup) \ud83c\udf31 To use the NorESM LandSites Platform, you need to install Git and Docker desktop before you can clone the repository (= download platform scripts) and start working with the Docker container. On your computer, Open file explorer and find a suitable folder to serve as working directory. This is where you will store the repository and ~2(?)GB needed by the platform, as well as your output files (which may take up quite a bit more space!). Your working directory should be somewhere on your C: drive, for instance C:/Users/yourusername , and it should not be e.g. on OneDrive or shared servers or System32. When you are in your chosen working directory, right-click and choose \"Git Bash here\". In the terminal that pops up, paste in the following line by right-clicking: $ git clone https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform.git This will download (= clone) the repository (= folder structure and files) to your working directory. You can now see the folder and files in your file explorer. Most of the files can be opened in a text editor like Notepad if you want to look at their contents. Once Git, Docker desktop and the repository are in place, you don't have to do this again. If the platform is updated the next time you want to use it, you probably want to update the repository by typing git pull into Git Bash from your local clone of the repository. 1. Start the container \ud83e\uddf0 In the working directory where you have cloned the repository, open a terminal by right-clicking and choosing \"Git Bash here\". Make sure you are in the folder containing the docker-compose.yml file (type ls and hit enter to list the files in the current folder). Then write this command and hit enter to get the container up and running: $ docker-compose up This will download some files and give you this address to access the container through your browser. To set custom simulation settings, start by going to http://localhost:5006/make_settings , or, if you want to skip that step, you can go directly to and use the password: pass. To stop the container running press Ctrl+c (in Git Bash). 2. Set simulation settings \u2699\ufe0f If you are doing a quick test with default platform settings , you can skip this step and go straight to 3. running your simulations . To set custom simulation settings , start by going to http://localhost:5006/make_settings in your browser. The page is quite self-explanatory and produces a new settings file that will be used to make cases that you can run. The different options are explained further in our documentation . (This step can also be done from a terminal by using make_cases.py interactively with the -i flag. -- see this guide ) 3. Run your simulations \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Go to the container in your browser: and use the password: pass to enter the container. You will see a lot of files and folders (= the GitHub repository contents). Navigate to the notebooks folder and open the one called run_simulations . It's an interactive Jupyter notebook where you can execute code in cells by clicking the play/run buttons next to them, and see the output directly below the cell. Alternatively, you can start a terminal in the container and execute these commands there: $ cd landsites_tools/simulation $ python make_cases.py $ python run_cases.py You are now running the model! Depending on your settings and machine hardware, making the case(s) and running the simulations might take some time to complete. \u23f3 If you got an error message somewhere along the way, please head over to our GitHub and write an issue describing what happened, what machine you are on (mac/windows/HPC etc.), and copy in the error message.

This is where you will store the repository and ~2(?)GB needed by the platform, as well as your output files (which may take up quite a bit more space!). Your working directory should be somewhere on your C: drive, for instance C:/Users/yourusername , and it should not be e.g. on OneDrive or shared servers or System32. When you are in your chosen working directory, right-click and choose \"Git Bash here\". In the terminal that pops up, paste in the following line by right-clicking: $ git clone https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform.git This will download (= clone) the repository (= folder structure and files) to your working directory. You can now see the folder and files in your file explorer. Most of the files can be opened in a text editor like Notepad if you want to look at their contents. Once Git, Docker desktop and the repository are in place, you don't have to do this again.
